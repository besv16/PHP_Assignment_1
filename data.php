$content1 = "An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me
that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. Despite the constant negative
ipsum covfefe. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully
understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good
decision.";
$content2 = "I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its
family, and I said to myself, 'I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's
inappropriate. It's not nice.' I was going to say something extremely rough to
Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, 'I can't do it. I just can't
do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.";
$content3 = "If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.
I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder
text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write
some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google
pay for that text. Mark my words.";
$content4 = "Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by
and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. Look at
that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next
webpage?!";
$content5 = "I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum,
but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China.
It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting
on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words,
perhaps I’d be dating it.";
$content6 = "That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. The best taco bowls
are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! My placeholder text, I think,
is going to end up being very good with women. Trump Ipsum is calling for a
total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website.";
$content7 = "Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not
keeping up with other websites. We are going to make placeholder text great
again. Greater than ever before. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can
you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?!";
$content8 = "This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. Lorem Ipsum's father was
with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. The best taco
bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!";
$content9 = "Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's
being, you know, shot. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text
coming out of her wherever. Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no 'tapes'
of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!";
$content10 = "You’re disgusting. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you
write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. I have a 10
year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.";
